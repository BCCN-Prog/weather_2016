PCP Protocol 17.05.16


Outline of the Minimum viable product

What do we want to show that we did?
- Put large amounts of data into a database (e.g. daily data)
- Being able to access data in database 
- Being able to scrape data 
- Being able to compare scraped and historical data
- Being able to provide a simple visualization of the data (map)

Restrictions:
- Daily data
- No or basic GUI

Outline of the MVP:
- Map of Germany, Color-Coded
- Temperature on a certain date
    - From historical data database
    - From scraping (1 Provider, 3 days)

Tasks
- DB towards Scraping: Greg
- DB towards Historical: Wolfi, Rahul
- DB towards Query: Georg
- Visualization (map): Max, Filip, later Denis
- Testing (Scraping): Jan, Denis



Things achieved during this session:
- Historical Data group: Done with hourly --> folders with daily and hourly data in csv format are now available, currently ongoing = optimization (maybe better later?)
- Georg: Daily works almost, should be similar for hourly, cooperation with Max for query engine is planned
- Greg: Testing for Georg's class 
- Alicja: Finished with downloading as well as scraping

Issues to figure out:
- indices for hourly data
