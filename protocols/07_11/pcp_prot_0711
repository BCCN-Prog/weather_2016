Protocol 07.11.

Things to present

GUI (Rahul, Wolfi): Historical data works fine, the scraped not yet, not sure whether they will be done until the presentation

Rain percentage (Greg, Alicja): Basic version seems realistic

Weather bot (Jan): Can tell jokes and can ask for date and location, but always predicts 21Â°C and sun.

Weekend bias (Claus): Not done yet but apparently realistic, maybe Eren can join?

Ice cream stats(Max, Ines): Basic version should work, statistics might not be very meaningful so some openly and ridiculously made up statistic might be an option.

Denis: did a lot of debugging!

Next meeting: Next monday, 15.00
Everything to present should be finished by then. All others
