Protocol 07.06.2016

Topics and goals to focus on for phase 2, started this session:

Query engine, functional side: (Georg)
    Basic database slicing algorithm works
    Issues: Performance, NaN handling, hourly data
    
Query engine GUI: (Wolfi, Rahul)
    Basic version works, looks good
    Can take parameter and pass on to query engine

Visualization: (Denis, Filip)
    Smoother and more beautiful interpolation of data points (ongoing)
    Animation: e.g. change of a parameter over time (not yet  started)
    
Report: (Claus, but only a little bit)
    PDF report for queries (first research done, existing package seems      complicated, idea: first render html page, then convert to pdf)
    
Scraping: 
    Debugging scrapers (Eren, Alicja)
    Improving/Finishing particular scraping scripts (Claus, Ines)
    
Testing database: Provided by Greg for Visualization and Report Group


    
Notes for next session:
    Query engine should have high priority, Georg should receive help
    Tackle and define some more complex questions in order to have a guideline for the improvisation of the code of other groups?
    Natural language processing of queries as a nice but not obligatory feature? (--> Denis)
