Historic Data:

Group Wolfi/Rahul:
- Downloading and Merging works
- so far: csv files
- Georg/Data representation group will work together on further data conversion

Group Max/Filip:
- able to deal with missing  data
- geographical mappings

Server/Eren: 
- Things going on with owm seem weird
- ongoing work on chrome jobs

Georg: 
- basic adding (manually works)
- data format: json, h5py
- pending: automation
- needed conversion location <-> postal codes

Scraping
- Claus: owm, uses Selenium
- Jan: hourly scraped to json format, daily ongoing
- Greg: html to use Goergs class/unique identifiers needed
--> ongoing work, mostly somewhere in data extraction

Problems:
- data has no check if duplicate --> timestamps
- database needs to be local, no network access to server --> should get as much work done locally as possible -> better to debug.

For next time:
- Discuss Slack
- Find a common ground on the 20 vs. 400 weather stations issue
- Testing!
