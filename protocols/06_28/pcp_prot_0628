PCP Protocol 28.06.16:

Decision wrt presentation: Scenarios that present the abilities of the Project as well as possible. See file 'ideas for pres' or similar in protocol folder of today.

Stuff done:

Visualization:
    Alicja, Greg: Working on plotting functions, looks promising though small stuff still has to be done

    Max: Colorbar for heatmap and animation, but is not done yet.

GUI (Wolfi, Rahul): Overall working well, should work for all kind of data, just some debugging needs to be done

Query engine (Georg): Issues with fancy indexing in h5py, so slowness issue is not easy to be solved quickly. Idea: cash that saves queries and their output. Queries for the presentation can be run the day before so that they are available at the day of the presentation

Eren: Issue: In both daily and hourly data, the temperature is always NAN --> bug
    Ines and Denis scraping script are still pending
    
NLP (Jan): API 'wit' used, basic versison is realistic, idea: add this to the BCCN slack group so people can ask for the weather and Chuck Norris jokes.
