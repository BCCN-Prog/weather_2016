PCP Prot 28.06.



For the presentation: 4 scenarios 
Idea: There are different scenes played where questions come up that are answered by the BCCN hero with help of the app.

Scenario 1:
Pessimist and optimist talk, pessimist says 'the rain probability is 60%, you can't go out/to that festival!' Optimist 'So there is a probability of 40% it does not rain? --> BCCN hero answers the question what the rain percentage actually means showing funny plots
What we show: Compare hourly scraped and historical data

Scenario 2:
Optimist 'But on the weekend the weather will be better!' Pessimist: 'Nah that's just what the weather websites say to make you like them more...
BCCN hero answers the question 'Is there a positive bias towards weekends?'
What we show: Compare daily scraped and historical data



Scenario 3: Two people wearing hats and gloves talk, A: 'Why is it so cold? It's July! Where is this stupid climate change?' BCCN hero shows whether climate change is real
What we show: animation, averaging over long times (full extent of the historical data)

Scenario 4: B: Huh, weird, I feel like ice cream... A: Yah that is kind of weird. Though scandinavian countries have the highest consumption of ice cream per person and year... B: You think people here also eat more ice cream when it is cold? BCCN hero answers that: (compare with graphs such as mean temp, days > 27Â°C, total sun shine duration
