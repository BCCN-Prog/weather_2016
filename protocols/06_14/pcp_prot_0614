Protocol  14.06.2016

Convention of indices for hourly data:
    - absolute times (i.e. 11 means 11 am)
    - add time stamp of dowloading as one parameter (int YYYYMMDDhhmm)
    - Create two dictionaries, one for the data for the same day, one for the data the next day
    - Jan has already implemented an example
    
Scraping Debugging (Eren, Alicja)
    - Alicjas script works, Denis ongoing, Jan and Ines not yet
    
Visualization
    - Animation works (on Hexagons)
    - Interpolation works, could be prettified 
    
GUI: (Rahul, Wolfi)
    - looks good, works, can seemingly easily be adapted

Database: (Georg)
    - Performance issues 
    - Need more people to work on optimizing this (crucial!!)

Query engine: (Greg)
    - vague, too much dependencies on things that are not done yet
    
Until next time:
    - define more concrete goals on what queries we want to make possible (wiki)
